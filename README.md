# PhotoAlbumKata

# Install SDK
This kata was done using .Net Core 2.1 SDK. Anyone who would attempt to run this on their computer may need to install the net core 2.1 SDK
The SDK can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1

# How to run
I ran the application inside of Visual Studio 2017. You can build the application using visual studio by using the shortcut ctrl F5 to
run with debugging or F5 to run without debugging. If you do this you will need to an an argument for the console application.
This can be done by going to the properties of the PhotoAlbumConsoleApp, go to debug section, and in application arguments type in
an integer value. You can also run it using dotnet build, followed by going to the project folder PhotoAlbumConsoleApp, and then typing
dotnet run -- 2. The number 2 can be any integer.
